    # Rules of the game: 
    # Scoring is the same as quidditch. 10 points for each quaffle, 150 points for each snitch.
    # The game will proceed until the snitch has been caught. 
    #   Each turn, the two teams of chasers will each get a chance for the quaffle. 
    # The chance a team wins the quaffle is (chaser / (chaser + opp beater)). So your chaser points divided by the sum of your chaser points and the opponent's beater points.
    #   In other words, if team A has 8 chaser points and team B has 4 beater points, team A has a 8/12 = 66% chance.
    # To score a goal, the chasers have to beat the keeper. the keeper has an Attribute % chance to make a save.
    #   If the team has a keeper attribute of 10, they'll have a 10% chance to make a save.
    # Finally, the two seekers will work independently. Each seeker will have a 1 + Attribute % chance to capture the snitch (the 1+ is to ensure the game definitively ends).
